                    <h5>Design Background and Porblem Solving</h5>
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The Roll-Aqua Barrel stands as an innovative solution to address the critical issue of limited access to drinkable water in LDC (Less Developed Countries) regions. Designed with the primary focus on cost-effectiveness, accessibility, low maintenance, and user-friendly operation, this portable water transport system aims to significantly alleviate the burden associated with water scarcity.

                   <p>
                    By providing a practical and affordable means of water filtration and transportation, the Roll-Aqua Barrel becomes a crucial tool in enhancing water accessibility and security, ultimately contributing to improved health and well-being in LDC communities. The design's simplicity and efficiency align with the specific needs of these regions, ensuring that it serves as a sustainable and impactful solution to a pressing problem.

                   <p>
                    The three-part modular design not only allows for easy assembly and disassembly but also serves the purpose of dividing the load into smaller, more manageable segments during transportation. The inclusion of a built-in filtration system in the base segment is a game-changer, empowering individuals to purify water on-site without the need for external resources. This not only reduces the dependence on centralized water sources but also mitigates the arduous task of traveling long distances to fetch drinkable water.

                     <h5>User scenario</h5>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>First Scenario - Water Transport Ease:</b> <br>
As I wake up in my village, the realization hits that fetching water for daily use involves a long and strenuous journey. Carrying a large amount of water is not only heavy but also exhausting. However, with the Roll-Aqua Barrel, the task becomes remarkably easier. I assemble the barrel, and instead of lifting the weight, I simply roll it effortlessly to the distant water source. The convenience of dragging or rolling the barrel minimizes the physical strain, making water transportation a much more manageable and efficient process.

                  </p>

                    <img src="img/Final/f-10.jpg" alt="" style="width: 220px;">
                    <img src="img/Final/f-11.jpg" alt="" style="width: 220px;">
                  </div>

                  <p>
                    <b>Second Scenario - Purification at the Source:</b> <br>
Living in an area where drinkable water is inaccessible, I find myself near a river, a potential source of water. However, the water in the river is not safe to drink. With the Roll-Aqua Barrel, equipped with an integrated water purification system, I can collect water from the nearby river without worry. The filtration system ensures that any water source, no matter how impure, can be turned into safe and drinkable water right at the point of collection, providing a vital solution to water scarcity.

                  <img src="img/Final/f-12.jpg" alt="" style="width:900px;">
                

              <p>
                <b>Third Scenario - Selective Water Usage:
                </b>
<br>
                After collecting water from the river, I realize that I don't need to purify all of it for my daily use. The Roll-Aqua Barrel comes to the rescue with its innovative design. I open the separate lid dedicated to non-purified water, allowing me to use the collected water without passing it through the purification system. This thoughtful feature not only conserves energy but also ensures that resources are used judiciously according to specific needs.

              <p>
                <b>Fourth Scenario - Nighttime Water Collection with Illumination:</b><br>
            
In the middle of the night, I run out of water, and the nearest water source is a dark journey away. The Roll-Aqua Barrel, equipped with integrated solar-powered light bulbs, becomes a beacon of convenience. I easily locate the barrel, thanks to its illuminating feature, and navigate my way to the river without the need for electricity. The solar-powered lights provide a reliable and eco-friendly solution for nighttime water collection, ensuring safety and accessibility in areas with limited power infrastructure.

                <h5>Water Purification Systems Research</h5>
              </p>
              <p>
                Water purification systems are designed to make water safe for drinking and other uses by removing impurities and contaminants:
</p>
<p>
  <p>
<b>1.Filtration:</b> One of the primary methods is filtration, where water passes through a filter that physically traps particles, sediment, and larger impurities. This is similar to how a sieve or strainer works in your kitchen.

  </p>
  <p>
<b>2.Sedimentation:</b> Some purification systems use sedimentation, allowing heavier particles to settle at the bottom of a container. The clearer water can then be drawn off from the top.
</p>
  <p>
    <b>3.Chemical Treatment:</b> Adding chemicals like chlorine or iodine to water can kill or neutralize harmful microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses. These chemicals are often used in municipal water treatment facilities.
 
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>4.Boiling:</b> Boiling water is a simple and effective method to kill many types of bacteria and parasites. This is a common practice in households without access to advanced purification systems.
  
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>5.Reverse Osmosis:</b> This is a more advanced method that uses a semi-permeable membrane to remove molecules and ions, leaving behind purified water. It's effective in removing a wide range of contaminants, including salts and microorganisms.
  
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>6.UV Purification:</b> Ultraviolet (UV) light can be used to disinfect water by inactivating bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms. UV light disrupts the DNA of these organisms, preventing them from reproducing.
  
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>7.Activated Carbon:</b> Many water filters use activated carbon to absorb impurities and contaminants. The porous surface of activated carbon attracts and traps molecules, removing them from the water.

  </p>
  
</p>
<p>
  Portable and small water filtration systems are designed for on-the-go use, making them convenient for activities like camping, hiking, or traveling. These systems are typically compact, lightweight, and easy to carry. One common type of portable water filter is a "personal water filter" or "straw filter.":

</p>

<p>
   <b>1.Filtration Mechanism:</b>These portable filters often use a filtration mechanism, such as a hollow fiber membrane or a microfiltration membrane, to physically block contaminants from passing through. The tiny pores in the membrane are designed to capture particles, bacteria, and parasites, preventing them from entering the drinking water.

</p>

<p>
  <b>2.Activated Carbon:</b> Many portable filters also include activated carbon. The activated carbon adsorbs (attracts and holds onto) certain chemicals, organic compounds, and unpleasant odors or tastes, improving the overall taste of the water.

</p>

<p>
  <b>3.Pump or Suction:</b>  Some portable filters require manual effort to draw water through the filtration system. This can be done through a hand pump or by using suction, similar to drinking through a straw. As you pump or suck, the water passes through the filter, where impurities are removed.

</p>

<p>
  <b>4.Chemical Treatment (Optional):</b> Some portable filters may incorporate chemical treatment components, such as iodine or other disinfectants, to kill or neutralize harmful microorganisms that may not be effectively captured by the physical filtration alone.

</p>

<p>
 <b>5.Maintenance:</b>  Portable water filters usually have a limited lifespan or a specified volume of water they can effectively filter before needing replacement or maintenance. This is important to consider when planning for extended trips.
