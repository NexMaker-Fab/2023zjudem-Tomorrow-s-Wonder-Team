                    In the quest for creating meaningful and impactful designs, our team embarked on a mission to address one of the most pressing issues faced by Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs): access to clean and portable water. 
                    <p>
                    The result of our collaborative efforts is the Aqua Barrel, a revolutionary solution designed to ease water transportation challenges and provide communities with a reliable source of purified water.

                    LCDs often grapple with the arduous task of transporting water from distant sources to their communities. Furthermore, the water obtained is frequently contaminated, leading to widespread health issues. Recognizing this predicament, our team sought to develop an innovative solution that not only simplifies water transportation but also ensures that the water is safe for consumption.

                  <p>
                    
                      Despite the fertility rate decreasing in less developed countries (LDCs) since the 1980s, their populations are still growing rapidly. From 2015 to 2020, the average number of children per woman in LDCs was four, while the global average was 2.5. Due to increased life expectancy without a corresponding decline in fertility, LDCs have an estimated population growth rate of 2.3%, twice the world average of 1.1%.
                      </p>
                       <p>
                     However, LDCs face challenges as they lack rapid improvements in productivity and employment. This rapid population growth increases the pressure on natural resources, hindering the achievement of a demographic dividend – a boost in economic growth resulting from demographic changes.

                      <h5>climate change:</h5> 
                    The October-December 2022 season marked the fifth consecutive failed rainfall season, with both short and long rains falling below average since 2020. This resulted in the worst drought in 40 years (WMO, 2022, FAO 2022). The drought caused significant issues like harvest failures, poor pasture conditions, livestock losses, reduced surface water, and human conflicts, affecting 4.35 million people who require humanitarian aid (NDMA, 2022). Over 180,000 refugees from Somalia and South Sudan sought refuge in the drought-affected regions of Kenya and Ethiopia (UNHCR).

Despite some reported rains in parts of Kenya by March 2023 (KMD, 2023), a quick recovery from the drought is unlikely, delaying improvements in food security until at least mid-2023.

                  <p>
                    <b>Second Scenario - Purification at the Source:</b> <br>
Living in an area where drinkable water is inaccessible, I find myself near a river, a potential source of water. However, the water in the river is not safe to drink. With the Roll-Aqua Barrel, equipped with an integrated water purification system, I can collect water from the nearby river without worry. The filtration system ensures that any water source, no matter how impure, can be turned into safe and drinkable water right at the point of collection, providing a vital solution to water scarcity.

                <b>Third Scenario - Selective Water Usage:
                </b>
<br>
                After collecting water from the river, I realize that I don't need to purify all of it for my daily use. The Roll-Aqua Barrel comes to the rescue with its innovative design. I open the separate lid dedicated to non-purified water, allowing me to use the collected water without passing it through the purification system. This thoughtful feature not only conserves energy but also ensures that resources are used judiciously according to specific needs.

                <h5>Water Purification Systems Research</h5>
              </p>
              <p>
                Water purification systems are designed to make water safe for drinking and other uses by removing impurities and contaminants:
</p>
<p>
  <p>
<b>1.Filtration:</b> One of the primary methods is filtration, where water passes through a filter that physically traps particles, sediment, and larger impurities. This is similar to how a sieve or strainer works in your kitchen.

  </p>
  <p>
<b>2.Sedimentation:</b> Some purification systems use sedimentation, allowing heavier particles to settle at the bottom of a container. The clearer water can then be drawn off from the top.
</p>
  <p>
    <b>3.Chemical Treatment:</b> Adding chemicals like chlorine or iodine to water can kill or neutralize harmful microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses. These chemicals are often used in municipal water treatment facilities.
 
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>4.Boiling:</b> Boiling water is a simple and effective method to kill many types of bacteria and parasites. This is a common practice in households without access to advanced purification systems.
  
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>5.Reverse Osmosis:</b> This is a more advanced method that uses a semi-permeable membrane to remove molecules and ions, leaving behind purified water. It's effective in removing a wide range of contaminants, including salts and microorganisms.
  
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>6.UV Purification:</b> Ultraviolet (UV) light can be used to disinfect water by inactivating bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms. UV light disrupts the DNA of these organisms, preventing them from reproducing.
  
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>7.Activated Carbon:</b> Many water filters use activated carbon to absorb impurities and contaminants. The porous surface of activated carbon attracts and traps molecules, removing them from the water.

  </p>
  
</p>
<p>
  Portable and small water filtration systems are designed for on-the-go use, making them convenient for activities like camping, hiking, or traveling. These systems are typically compact, lightweight, and easy to carry. One common type of portable water filter is a "personal water filter" or "straw filter.":

</p>

<p>
   <b>1.Filtration Mechanism:</b>These portable filters often use a filtration mechanism, such as a hollow fiber membrane or a microfiltration membrane, to physically block contaminants from passing through. The tiny pores in the membrane are designed to capture particles, bacteria, and parasites, preventing them from entering the drinking water.

</p>

<p>
  <b>2.Activated Carbon:</b> Many portable filters also include activated carbon. The activated carbon adsorbs (attracts and holds onto) certain chemicals, organic compounds, and unpleasant odors or tastes, improving the overall taste of the water.

</p>

<p>
  <b>3.Pump or Suction:</b>  Some portable filters require manual effort to draw water through the filtration system. This can be done through a hand pump or by using suction, similar to drinking through a straw. As you pump or suck, the water passes through the filter, where impurities are removed.

</p>

<p>
  <b>4.Chemical Treatment (Optional):</b> Some portable filters may incorporate chemical treatment components, such as iodine or other disinfectants, to kill or neutralize harmful microorganisms that may not be effectively captured by the physical filtration alone.

</p>

<p>
 <b>5.Maintenance:</b>  Portable water filters usually have a limited lifespan or a specified volume of water they can effectively filter before needing replacement or maintenance. This is important to consider when planning for extended trips.

<h5>Water Purification check with Arduino</h5>


<b>Turbidity Monitoring:</b>
<p>
 The turbidity sensor is placed in the water to be filtered.
It continuously measures turbidity levels in the water. 
</p>


<b>Arduino Processing:</b>

<p>
The Arduino reads turbidity sensor data.
<br>

It categorizes water quality into:

<li>
  Dirty (Low, 60%-100%), Medium, and High turbidity.
</li>
<li>
  Cloudy (medium, 30%-59%)
</li>
<li>
  Clear (High quality, 0%-29%)
</li>

<h5>For future consideration:</h5>

<li>

  Gaskets to seal the end s of barrels
</li>
<li>

  Locking mechanism for the top cover in order for it to to take the forces of rolling on the ground.
</li>
<li>

  Testing with different filters for the turbidity test
</li>
<li>

  Integrate the turbidity into the barrel design with compromising the design, structure
</li>

  <h5> Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</h5>
</p>
<p>
  Billions of people still lack access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene, despite improvement in the provision of these basic services. Water scarcity is a growing problem in many parts of the world, and conflicts and climate change are exacerbating the issue. In addition, water pollution is a significant challenge which affects both human health and the environment in many countries.

</p>
<p>
  The COVID-19 pandemic poses an additional impediment, impairing access for billions of people to safely managed drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services – services desperately needed to prevent the virus from spreading. 
  <br>Now more than ever the world needs to transform the way it manages its water resources and delivers water and sanitation services for billions of people. Urgent action is needed to overcome this global crisis, as it is affecting all countries around the world, socially, economically and environmentally. 
  <br>Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) on water and sanitation, adopted by United Nations Member States at the 2015 UN Summit as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, provides the blueprint for ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.
